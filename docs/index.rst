FastEddy® (FE) is a large-eddy simulation (LES) model developed by the
Research Applications Laboratory (RAL) at the National Center for Atmospheric
Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado, USA. The fundamental premise of FastEddy
model development is to leverage the accelerated and more power efficient
computing capacity of graphics processing units (GPU)s to enable not only more
widespread use of LES in research activities but also to pursue the adoption of
microscale and multiscale, turbulence-resolving, atmospheric boundary layer
modeling into local scale weather prediction or actionable science and
engineering applications.
